we are every week given a kind of a db-file in the formate of an office-calculation-table.
this file happens to be without any assignments and it is demanded that the outcome is a pdf for another department.

this is a little command line programm to solve this problem by letting the user assign the values.
after the assigning process the programm will generate a pdf with generically made passwords.

annotations:
passwords 8 digits, only distinguishable characters, signs and numbers, german-us-keyboard-layouts do not matter.
due to its design it is possible to adjust further requirements in the written functions.
