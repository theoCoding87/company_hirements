we are every week given a kind of a db-file in the formate of an office-calculation-table.
this file happens to be without any assignments and it is demanded that the outcome is a pdf for another department.

it turned out that the creation of the demanded outcome is not easy to do with the method of a serial letter.

this is a little command line programm to solve this problem by letting the user assign the values.
after the assigning process the programm will generate a pdf with generically made passwords.

annotations:
passwords 8 digits, only distinguishable characters, signs and numbers.
due to its design it is possible to adjust further requirements in the written functions.
